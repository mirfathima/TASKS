A power bank, also known as a portable charger, is a compact, battery-based device designed to recharge various electronic gadgets when traditional power sources are unavailable.
These devices store electrical energy, which can then be used to charge mobile phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, and other portable devices. 
They are frequently used when traveling or camping since they let gadgets be charged without the need for an outlet.
Power banks are available in a number of sizes and capacities, allowing you to select one that best suits your needs.
