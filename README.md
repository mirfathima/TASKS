# TASKS
Python - Concepts
# Data Types and Slicing Python script
 -Demonstrates the use of different data types in a list named mixed_data. It includes integers, floats, and strings. The program showcases slicing techniques to extract subsets of elements, such as the first three, elements from the 2nd to 5th position, and the last two elements.

# Functions Python script
-Defines a function, calculate_discount, that takes an original price and an optional discount percentage (default is 10%). The function calculates the discount amount and returns the discounted price. The program then demonstrates the function by applying a 10% discount to an original price of $100, showcasing the original and discounted prices.

# Control Flow Python script 
-Illustrates control flow structures. It evaluates the discounted price to determine if the item is low-cost, moderate-cost, or high-cost. Additionally, it iterates through a list of mixed data types, printing each element along with its data type until encountering a None value, at which point it breaks out of the loop.

# File Handling Python script
-Defines a function, capitalize_file_data, which reads text from "product_descriptions.txt," capitalizes the first letter of each word, and writes the formatted data to "formatted_descriptions.txt." The program then calls this function to execute the file handling operation.

# Advanced Data Structure Python script
-Showcases an advanced data structure: a dictionary named 'customer_info.' It stores information about a customer, including name, age, and purchase history. The program extracts and prints the customer's name and the second purchase from the purchase history, demonstrating the use of dictionaries for structured data storage.
Also describe what is a function in this program, how it is defined, what is teh functioning & output of this program.

# Classes and Objects Python script 
-Defines a class, Book, with methods for initializing, setting, and displaying book information. An instance, book_instance, is created and its initial information is displayed. The information is then updated using the set_information method, and the modified details are displayed.
